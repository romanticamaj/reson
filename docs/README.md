## Current Direction

SIANN is a local AI-native music production environment:

```text
Ardour-derived audio core
+ SIANN headless engine runtime
+ command bridge
+ pluggable AI runtime
+ AI-friendly studio UI
```

The current milestone is the SIANN core command surface: prove that the
headless runtime can create and own a session, observe it, apply editing
commands, render previews, roll back safely, and still emit Ardour-compatible
session artifacts for visual verification.

## Current Implementation Status

SIANN now has two active codebases:

- `/Users/garyhsieh/siann-engine` is the Ardour-derived engine fork. It contains the C++ `session_utils/siann_command.cc` runner that directly opens and mutates Ardour sessions.
- `/Users/garyhsieh/siann` is the product, docs, and developer bridge repo. It now contains a Node CLI wrapper, workflow generators, approval-gated plan files, example fixtures, and tests. It is not docs-only anymore, but it does not yet contain the future Studio UI or AI runtime.

Current shipped workflow:

```text
extracted DAW test pack
-> multi-track manifest
-> reviewable import plan
-> explicit approval gate
-> engine command batch
-> Ardour session mutation
-> preview render
-> journaled rollback
```

The real-user DAW pack workflow supports:

- `_DAW/` BGM assets.
- `_DAW/placement.md` in-point and duration parsing.
- `_SpliceSFX/` sound effects.
- One track per BGM bed or SFX cue.
- `sourceStart` and `duration` trim metadata.
- Rendered preview WAV output.
- Ardour session output for visual inspection.
- DAWproject export for Cubase-compatible project exchange.

The next product layer is the SIANN headless engine runtime: a persistent,
SIANN-owned session process that future UI and agent clients can control. Ardour
compatibility remains useful for verification, but opening arbitrary Ardour
projects is not the primary workflow.
