# Windows Setup

This guide covers the SIANN product/bridge repo on Windows. The DAWproject
export path is fully Node-based and is the first Windows verification target.

The Ardour-derived engine runtime is a separate checkout and still needs its own
Windows build story. Use the Windows flow below to verify intake planning,
manifest generation, and Cubase-compatible `.dawproject` export first.

## What This Repo Can Run

After cloning only `romanticamaj/siann`, a developer or agent session can:

- Load the `siann-intake` skill when the client supports repo-local or
  user-level skills.
- Inspect audio files and placement notes.
- Generate a SIANN import-pack manifest.
- Export a Cubase-compatible `.dawproject` package.
- Run Node tests and DAWproject smoke tests.

This path does not compile or launch the SIANN audio engine.

The separate `romanticamaj/siann-engine` checkout is only required for live
session commands such as `node bin/siann.js live import-pack ...`, preview
rendering through the engine runtime, Ardour session mutation, and engine
integration tests.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11.
- Git for Windows.
- Node.js 20 or newer.
- Cubase 14.0.20 or newer for DAWproject import testing.

Optional:

- PowerShell 7.
- WSL2 for engine-side experiments before native Windows engine support is
  ready.

## Clone And Test

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/romanticamaj/siann.git
cd siann
node --version
npm test
```

## DAWproject Smoke Test

This command creates demo WAV files, writes a portable manifest, exports a
DAWproject package, and verifies the package entries using Node only.

```powershell
node scripts/smoke-dawproject.js --out "$env:TEMP\siann-dawproject-smoke" --json
```

Equivalent npm command:

```powershell
npm run smoke:dawproject -- --out "$env:TEMP\siann-dawproject-smoke" --json
```

Expected output includes:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "workflow": "smoke-dawproject",
  "outputFile": "..."
}
```

Open the reported `session.dawproject` in Cubase:

```text
File > Import > DAWproject
```

## Test A User Audio Pack

If you have a zip with `_DAW/`, `_SpliceSFX/`, and optional placement notes,
extract it first:

```powershell
$source = "$env:TEMP\siann-user-example-source"
$out = "$env:TEMP\siann-user-example-export"
Remove-Item $source, $out -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Expand-Archive -Path "$HOME\Downloads\_DAW.zip" -DestinationPath $source -Force
node scripts/create-daw-manifest.js $source `
  --out "$out\manifest.json" `
  --session-dir "$out\Session" `
  --preview "$out\preview.wav" `
  --journal "$out\journal.json" `
  --json
node bin/siann.js export dawproject "$out\manifest.json" `
  --out "$out\session.dawproject" `
  --copy-media `
  --json
```

Then import:

```text
File > Import > DAWproject
```

## Agent Skill Install

Repo-local skills are committed under:

```text
.codex/skills/siann-intake/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/siann-intake/SKILL.md
```

Some clients do not auto-load repo-local skills. If a new session cannot see
`siann-intake`, copy the canonical skill into the user-level skill root used by
that client. On Windows, common locations are under your user profile, for
example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.codex\skills\siann-intake"
Copy-Item ".codex\skills\siann-intake\SKILL.md" "$HOME\.codex\skills\siann-intake\SKILL.md" -Force
```

Restart the agent session after installing the skill.

## Engine Checkout

The engine is intentionally not a submodule today. Keep it as a sibling checkout
when you need engine-facing work:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/romanticamaj/siann.git
git clone https://github.com/romanticamaj/siann-engine.git
```

The bridge defaults to `..\siann-engine` from the product repo. Use
`--engine-dir <path>` or `SIANN_ENGINE_DIR=<path>` if the engine checkout lives
somewhere else.

Do not start Windows validation by building the engine. First verify the
Node-only DAWproject path, then treat native Windows engine support as a
separate milestone.

## Current Limits

- DAWproject export supports WAV media only.
- DAWproject XML schema validation with `xmllint` is optional on Windows; the
  Node smoke test validates package shape without external tools.
- `live import-pack` requires the Ardour-derived SIANN engine runtime. Treat it
  as a separate engine-build milestone on Windows.
